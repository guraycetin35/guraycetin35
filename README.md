-Hi! I am Güray and am interested in GeoData, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I had a background in HTML, CSS and JavaScript in my bachelor. As a final thesis , i personelly developed a Google Mashup project that calcutes the area and length of selected two points on the Elipsoid. This is based on Geodesy Formulas and the result seem on the Google Maps as bounding box. Also, I developed a converter from Cartesian Coordinate to Geographical Coordinates or vice versa, which enables seeing wanted point location on the Google Map.I continue my education on Geodesy and Geodata Science field.Currently, i am  eager to develop myself on Python, Data Manipulation and Visualization, Machine Learning and Computer Science.
